## Team 3 ML

- ML_eda.ipynb: Does all the EDA of our dataset and cleans it ready for ML
- ML_datacleaning.ipynb: Just the data cleaning parts of 'ML_eda.ipynb'. Will be made into .py file
- ML_datacleaning.py: Python script to run all the data cleaning to make the ML dataset

Could send the ML dataset back to GCP to do bqML or AutoML. Or make a script here that trains the price regression model.
